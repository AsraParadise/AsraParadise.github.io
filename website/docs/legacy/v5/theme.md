Let's create a new theme!

Navigate to your WordPress theme folder and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-wp-project
```

The script will prompt you for a theme name and local development URL (used for BrowserSync). After that, your new theme will be installed:

![](/eightshift-docs/img/setup.gif)

After the script is finished, please follow the instructions provided by the setup script.

All additional steps after the initial setup are done using WP_CLI commands, so please make sure that you have WP-CLI set and ready to use.

## What is next?
Now that we have the theme set on your local environment, let's do something with it.

Please make sure you read the [Basics chapter](basics/basics) to understand better how the project is set and what is included to make your developing experience as smooth as possible.
