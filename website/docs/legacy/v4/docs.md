## Boilerplate building blocks

In order to use it, you need to understand what makes boilerplate tick. In theory, this is simple, you have 2 parts.

### 1. Eightshift Libs - [docs](libs.md) | [github](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs)

This is where all the backend (PHP) code is kept. Think abstract classes, interfaces, dependency injection, asset enqueuing, filter & actions.

### 2. Eightshift Frontend Libs - [docs](frontend-libs.md) | [github](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs)

This is where all the front-end (JS, SCSS, assets) code is kept.
