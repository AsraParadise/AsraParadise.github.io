### Website Rewrite

Website upgrades took place for serveral days at the end of December and again this week, simplifying the website and making it more intutive to find the things you need.
Staff Applications for Asra Paradise also moved onto the website as opposed to the previous Google Form along with increased support and command information within the website.
