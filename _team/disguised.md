Hey! I'm Disguised and the owner of Asra as well as the Asra Paradise community server.

I launched Asra Paradise to the public on the 18th January 2021 and it grew so fast when we started out, reaching 500 members in only 2 months.
Some of you may notice that the server says it was created on the 3rd July 2020 and this is because I created the server just after I created my account but it sat unused for a number of months with just 2 or 3 of my friends in it.
In January, I made the decision to launch my own server using my experience gained from moderating and co-owning many other servers.
My mission was to make an amazing community server and provide the perfect place for everyone to make friends and meet new people.

I later decided I wanted to make my own bot for the server with the hope that one day it would be able to replace every single other bot in the server. It was added on the 27th March 2021 with only a couple commands and has been worked on ever since gradually adding more commands and more features until it became what it is today.

I recieved many requests from people asking if they could have the bot in their server but I initially declined all of these requests as I had intended for the bot to just be a custom-built bot to serve the Asra Paradise server and had hard-coded it to do so. In December 2021 however, I started thinking that maybe I could open it to the public and let other people enjoy the benefits of Asra. After making a decision, I immediately began work on rewriting the bot and making it dynamic and as customisable as possible allowing users to specify roles, channels and more.

Fast forward 2 months to February 2022 where the bot has been approved by a few advertising sites and is starting to appear gradually in a few more servers. I've teamed up with Souluxe who has created and will be running our new bot Asra Music! This will be a great partnership and will allow us to make more progress with each bot through shared knowledge. This also meant merging support servers and websites so everything is all in one place for both bots.
